- [x] Print the string `Hello, world`

```ruby
puts 'Hello, world'
```


- [x] Find index of `Ruby` in `Hello, Ruby`


```ruby
'Hello, Ruby'.index('Ruby')
```

Print your name 10 times

```ruby
# Long form
for i in 1..10
  puts 'LTT'
end

# One lineer for long form. This also remind me that I too used to see semicolon
# in code.
for i in 1..10; puts 'LTT'; end

# Short form 1
10.times do puts 'LTT' end

# Short form 2
(1..10).each do puts 'LTT' end

```
There's so many way to do loop in Ruby.


- [ ] Print the string "This is sentence number 1" where the number change from
  1 to 10.

Skip this as it's basically the same with above task

- [x] Run a Ruby program from a file

```bash
ruby ./hello.rb
```

- [ ] Bonus, program for guessing random number.

Skip, time consuming.
